          <h3>Description/Objective</h3>
          <p class="item-text">This python application allows users to browse through some of my favorite solutions to assignments from an algorithms class. The user interface for the application is built using tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. The application presents the solutions in an organized and easy-to-read format, making it a useful resource for anyone interested in learning about algorithm design. In addition to providing the solutions, the application also includes a brief explanation of the problem and my thought process in arriving at the solution. This project is a great way for me to share my knowledge and experience with others, and I hope it will be a helpful resource for anyone interested in algorithms and problem-solving.</p>
